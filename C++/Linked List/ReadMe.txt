Adding everything to a linked list is a difficult way to keep track
of each state.  This brute force method has to go through every
possibility of each board till the right one is found instead of 
working through the most logical and fastest method and abandoning
the loops right there.

Originally I attempted to program the method for solving recursively,
but it became too difficult to track each layer and which direction
the board had originally gone.

I would have liked to line this all up on a queue, but I wasn't
confident in my ability to do so.
